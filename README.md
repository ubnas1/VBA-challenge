# VBA-challenge

In this project I was given a dataset of Stock Market companies. It contains 2,268,000 rows of data divided into 3 different sheets for 2018, 2019, 2020 respectively.

I have completed the analysis and have presented foloowing Data.

For each company, the code will provide Ticker, Yearly Change, % Change, Total Stock Volume for the year, open price and close price for the year.

It also shows the greatest total volume increase, greatest % increase and greatest % decrease for every year in a seperate table including their ticker and values.

The code loops through all sheets and shows their calculated data on each of the sheets.

Screenshots of the working project are also included in the repository as samples.

Seperate VBA script file is also included.
